//! List of lexemes.
//!
//! The list of all lexemes, aka tokens, is provided by the PHP Language
//! Specification in the [Grammar
//! chapter](https://github.com/php/php-langspec/blob/master/spec/19-grammar.md#lexical-grammar).
//!
//! All lexemes are declared as static string constants.

/// Helper to declare a token.
///
/// ### Examples
///
/// The following example declares the `FOO_BAR` token:
///
/// ```
/// token!(FOO_BAR: "foobar"; "The `FOO_BAR` token, mostly used in example.");
/// ```
macro_rules! token {
    ($name:ident: $value:expr; $documentation:expr) => (
        #[doc=$documentation]
        pub const $name: &'static str = $value;
    )
}

token!(PLUS: "+"; "The `PLUS` token.\n\nUsed for instance in an arithmetic operation like `1 + 2`.");
